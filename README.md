# Project Euler- 3 like numbers
This program takes in a number and returns the number of substrings within 
said number that are divisible by 3. A more in-depth description of this 
can be found within [Plan](doc/Plan.md).  
At the moment, the program only implements the first and most simple function. I aim 
to later implement the entire problem.
